<p align='justify'>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Doug. My background is a little unique in the Data Science world, as I have spent a number of years in talent acquisition, sales, management, and consulting, before switching gears. The data was never supposed to be my main focus in those roles, yet I was always more interested in combing through the it to uncover a new lead or an undiscovered pattern than doing anything else. From constructing dashboards to identifying key, specific metrics for individual team members to improve their performance, I seemed to keep finding myself knee deep in data. After years of tinkering, I took the plunge and have immersed myself in the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and all things predictive. I am eager to see what I will discover moving forward.</p>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding a new role with a progressive organization.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment, but I am always looking to learn something new.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything. I am an open book.  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him  

My respositories are a collection of projects I have been working on over the last year or so.  
Please take a look and let me know what you think.
