<p align='justify'>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Doug, and I am currently completing my capstone course for my Masters in Data Science from Bellevue University. My background is a little unique in the Data Science world, as I have spent a number of years in talent acquisition, sales, management, and consulting, before switching gears. The data was never supposed to be my main focus in those roles, yet I was always more interested in combing through the it to uncover a new lead or an undiscovered pattern than doing anything else. From constructing dashboards to identifying key, specific metrics for individual team members to improve their performance, I seemed to keep finding myself knee deep in data. After years of tinkering, I took the plunge and have immersed myself in the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and all things predictive. I am eager to see what I will discover moving forward.</p>
